# Runtime — Roadmap & Backlog

**Checkpoint date:** 2026-06-08
**Current state:** Runtime spine complete (Milestones 1–3 merged to `master`).
**Goal:** an on-prem, open-source equivalent of AWS Bedrock AgentCore.

This file is the parking lot for everything *not yet built*. Each item below is a
future unit of work (its own brainstorm → spec → plan → execute cycle, the same
flow used for M1–M3). Design specs and plans live in `docs/superpowers/`.

## ✅ Done — the Runtime spine (sub-project 1 of 6)

The first sub-project from the original decomposition is complete, in three
milestones (all merged to `master`):

- **M1 — Durable walking skeleton** (`a163b1f`): one agent as a supervised
  subprocess; harness loop wrapped as a DBOS workflow (turn = durable step);
  kill-mid-turn resume proven. Added `RunTurn` to harness.
- **M2 — Multi-agent platform** (`81a11b8`): config-driven registry
  (`runtime.yaml`), `/agents/{id}` path routing, one subprocess per agent,
  session status/turn tracking, cross-agent session listing, full CLI.
- **M3 — Operability layer** (`755fc6d`): token auth (header/cookie, open mode),
  read-only web console (`/ui`), structured `slog`, contract conformance suite +
  `runtimectl conformance`, bounded shutdown, 503-on-restart, per-agent health,
  full-stack Dockerfile + compose.

Reference docs: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-07-runtime-spine-design.md` (the
overall Approach-2 design + the 6-sub-project decomposition) and the per-milestone
specs/plans dated 2026-06-07/08.

## 🔜 Remaining work

### A. Spine hardening (within this sub-project — optional, do when needed)

Carried-forward debt flagged during M1–M3 reviews. None blocking; pick up if/when
the use case demands. Recorded in the M3 README "Status, scope & limitations".

1. **Subprocess pools / replicas per agent** — today one subprocess per agent.
   Needs session→replica affinity (a session must hit the replica whose DBOS
   workflow it is). Pulls in real routing complexity. (Deferred from M2.)
2. **Autoscaling** — scale replicas by load. Depends on pools (A1).
3. **Dynamic deploy** — `POST /agents` runtime registration + rollback; today
   agents come from `runtime.yaml` at startup. Tokens are config-only too.
4. **`session_events` concurrency** — `SELECT MAX(seq)+1` is safe only because
   one subprocess owns a session (one writer). Revisit (lock / sequence /
   `ON CONFLICT` retry) if a session ever gets concurrent writers (e.g. pools).
5. **DBOS recovery across a recompiled binary** — recovery keys on the agentd
   binary's app-version hash; recovering a workflow across a code change needs
   `DBOS__APPVERSION` pinned. Document/operationalize if doing rolling upgrades.
6. **Cross-agent aggregate session view** — session listing is per-agent; a
   fleet-wide view (and richer console health) is future console work.
7. **Constant-time token compare + token hashing-at-rest** — M3 uses a plain map
   lookup; fine for static config tokens. Folds naturally into Identity (B3).
8. **Access-log already wired** (M3) — but no metrics/tracing yet (see B5).

### B. The other 5 sub-projects (from the original decomposition)

Each is a peer of the Runtime spine — its own spec → plan → build cycle. Rough
dependency order: they all sit on the spine; Identity should likely precede
exposing the platform broadly.

1. **Gateway** — tool / MCP federation. Turn APIs/services into agent-callable
   tools; a central MCP endpoint with discovery, auth, and semantic tool search.
   Builds on harness `tools/mcp`. Independently useful (any agent can point at it).
2. **Memory** — managed multi-tenant memory. Short + long term, semantic
   retrieval across sessions, per-tenant isolation. Builds on harness
   `tool/memory` + Postgres/pgvector (pgvector is already provisioned in the
   Compose image, unused so far).
3. **Identity** — proper auth done right: agent identity, secrets brokering,
   OAuth, RBAC, per-user/multi-tenant. Supersedes M3's simple bearer tokens.
   Likely the next priority before broad exposure. (Absorbs A7.)
4. **Sandboxes** — isolated **browser tool** + **code interpreter** for agents.
   Integrate gVisor/Firecracker for isolation; chromedp for browser. The
   conformance suite (M3) already validates the agent contract that sandboxed
   tools would run behind.
5. **Observability** — tracing, metrics, dashboards. The structured `slog` from
   M3 is the lightweight precursor; this is the full version (OpenTelemetry +
   Grafana, or similar). (Absorbs A8.)

### C. Cross-cutting / platform-level (later)

- **Containers / Kubernetes** — host arbitrary containerized agents (any
  language), not just harness-native Go subprocesses. The agent HTTP/SSE
  contract was deliberately designed to admit this; the conformance suite
  already validates any binary against it. Then Helm charts / an operator for
  orchestrated scale (the "K8s later" half of the deploy decision).

## How to resume a piece

Pick an item, then run the standard flow (it's worked well for M1–M3):
1. `brainstorming` skill → settle the open design decisions, write the spec to
   `docs/superpowers/specs/`.
2. `writing-plans` skill → TDD plan to `docs/superpowers/plans/`.
3. `subagent-driven-development` → execute task-by-task with two-stage review,
   on a `feat/<name>` branch.
4. `finishing-a-development-branch` → merge to `master`.

**Conventions that matter** (learned across M1–M3):
- The `go` CLI is ground truth; the IDE/LSP is confused by the
  `replace github.com/sausheong/harness => ../harness` cross-module setup —
  ignore its diagnostics, trust `go build`/`go test`.
- Integration tests are `//go:build integration`, need Postgres at
  `postgres://runtime:runtime@localhost:5432/runtime?sslmode=disable` (local
  Postgres.app, not Docker), and self-clean their DB + the `dbos` schema.
- DBOS v0.16.0 API notes: `docs/superpowers/plans/dbos-v0.16.0-api-notes.md`.
- harness lives at `../harness` (owned; M1 added `RunTurn` to it).
